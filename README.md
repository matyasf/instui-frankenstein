This is a test project for exploring how InstUI v7 and v8 can live together. The project has the following setup:

- it uses the v7 toolchain (e.g. `ui-scripts`, babel config)   
- it includes the v7 themeable library so one can use e.g. `@themeable`
- it includes all v8 components

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the
console.

### `yarn build`

### `yarn babel`

### `yarn lint`
